# main.com.py

A simple static website for the `main.com.py` domain, built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

Ironically, this website doesn't use Python.

## Running locally

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with a static server.
- Quick static server (Python 3):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

## Experiments

Open `experiments/index.html` to see links to small projects and demos.
